# CSS-Zen-Garden

## Student project based on CSS Zen Garden
## Additionally, introduction to Sass (SCSS) and building with Gulp

1. Do not edit the index.html file, only the .scss files.
2. The "Zen Garden Base" file is there for reference, but not included in the sass build.
3. Feel free to add new .scss files, but remember to also add them to the style.scss index

From your terminal (in the project directory), run:
`npm run gulp` to continually rebuild the CSS every time you save a .scss file...

On a Mac, ctrl + c will quit your gulp-watch process.

## Initial installation
To install your project for the first time, run `npm install` from the terminal (in the project directory). If you wish to clone this repo to multiple computers, you have to run `npm install` on each machine.
